Functioning prototyping is one of the major improvements addded to c++ funcions.
The prototype describes the function interface to the compiler by giving details such as the number and the type of arguments and the type of return values.
With function prototyping, a template is always used when declarig and defining a function.
When a function is called ,the compiler uses the template to ensure that proper arguments are passed and the return values is treared correctly.
Funtion prototyping is a declaration statement inthe calling program and is of the following form:
  type function-name(arugument list);
  
  float volume(int x, float y,float z);
  float volume(int x,float y ,z) is illegal

In function declaration the name of the arguments are optional.
float volume(int,float,float) is acceptable.

In the function definition, names are required because the arguments must be referenced inside the function:
EX:
  float volume(int a ,float b, floatc){
      float v=a*b*c;
  }
  
 In c++ ,
      void display(void);
      means that the function doesn't pass any parameters.
