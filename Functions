Functions play an important role in C program development.
Dividing programs into functions is one of the major principles of top-down,structured programming.
Another advantage of using functions is that it is possible to resize the size of the program by calling and using them at different places in the program.
Syntax...
void show();  //function declaration
main()
{
  show();   //function calling
}
void show() //function defintion
{
  ''''      //function body
}
